# oauthv1_quickbooks
OAuth Version 1 written in GO. 

This OAuth package was built for the Quickbooks API. The API was strange in that it only seemed to work with GET methods instead of POST. 

Check out oauthv1_quickbooks_example to see how this package is used with Quickbooks. The index.html has the little bit of Javascript from Quickbooks to make the connect button appear.
